Brisbane Catchments Network has given the task of creating a game that inspires its players to learn more about Brisbane’s biodiversity. 

To achieve this goal, we developed a game that intended on allowing the player to explore how Brisbane’s biodiversity lives as opposed to just telling them about biodiversity. 

The game itself is a third person simulation of the modern-day Bulimba Creek Catchment area specifically. Users will play as a White Ibis from a third person high camera perspective and they will be up to them to explore their surroundings and survive for a full five minutes. The look of this game will be a 3D low poly look with a colour palette consisting of natural earthy colours. This is to keep the game simple enough for anyone to understand while not being too unrealistically simple. The core mechanics of the game will consist of the player interacting with native plants and animals to discover which are the Ibis’s prey and which are the Ibis’s predators. 

To summarise how this game design will adhere to the given project brief, It will be designed for use on an android phone, all plants and animals found within the game have to be chosen because of their appearance within the Bulimba Creek Catchment area, core mechanics are inspired by the relationships between the plants and animals found within the Bulimba Creek Catchment area and the gameplay loop and controls will be simple enough for anyone to understand without sacrificing important details/interactions.
